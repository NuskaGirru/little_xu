            <h1> Building habits. Three guidelines to sustain your habits</h1>
        </section>

        <section class="article-body">

            <p>A couple of years ago I found the idea of writing Morning pages in Julia Cameron's book "The Artists Way". It is pretty simple - every morning you write three pages. You do this for the sake of the process and don't think about the product. You don't worry about the grammar or loosing your though. Write about whatever. Pretty simple. But you do this every day. </p>
            <br>
            <p>I got inspired by the book and found the perfect notebook (even thou you can do it just on pieces of paper) to write in. Two months went by and I was writing every morning. One day I spent the night at my friend's place and was running around the city till evening the next day. So when I came home  I was tired and sleepy. This meant that I didn't write in my notebook that day. And this is where it all got wrong. Next day I woke up in my bed, looked at my morning pages notebook and thought: </p>
            <br>

            <p> - "I'm not in the mood today. It's okay to skip it". </p>
            <br>

            <p>This perfectly describes all my attempts at building habits. Be that writing, meditating, doing yoga, vocal exercises, making a healthy breakfast every day and many many others. </p>
            <br>
            <p> It's always the rush of starting something new and simple every day. Skipping once for some reason (including being sick which definitely prevents yoga or vocal workouts) and never going back. </p>
            <br>

            <p> I used to think that you need to do something for 21 days to build a habit. However, even after 120 days I still can't keep up the habit after one skipped day. </p>
            <br>
            <p> So I think that there are three ways to combat this problem. </p>
            <br>
            <p> 1. Create an MVA (minimum viable action) for yourself </p>
            <br>
            <p> My friend told me about this idea and she read it in one of Barbara Sher's books. So you want to learn to play guitar. Pick the minimum action that you are willing to do every day. It can be something as simple as playing one chord or just holding the guitar in your hands. Commit to doing that every day. Of course, you can do more than this MVA. Just know, no matter how much time you spent today on your habit tomorrow you still need to play at least that one chord. This action might change in time. It can develop into playing one song or something. Just remember - it's all about showing up and doing something. </p>
            <br>
            <p> 2. Pick the time slot </p>
            <br>
            <p> So you do a thing. Let's say you start doing vocal exercises. But the first day is a bit uncomfortable. You are afraid that someone is going to hear your voice. So you put it off till the evening. Till the last possible moment. Either you sing now or it's not today cause your neighbours want some quiet at night. So you have to do it now. And it's not as bad as you imagined. You have fun. So the pressure of doing it for the first time is off. </p>
            <br>
            <p> Then comes the next day. And for the sake of my point let's say that you are not afraid to start anymore. But still, you wait till the last possible moment to do it. This keeps happening. And for some inexplicable reason, you keep waiting for the last possible moment. The truth is that it's not about that last possible moment. It's about a particular time of the day you now associate with doing that vocal workout. I remember once catching myself just sitting there and waiting for the time to be 10:30 pm to start. I wasn't busy, I wasn't watching a movie, I was looking at the clock and waiting. </p>
            <br>
            <p> It is very easy to cling to a particular number on the clock and to "forever" associate it with a particular activity. and I don't think that the trick is to fight it. I think that it can be empowering to embrace it. Just think about this before you start a habit. Think about the time it will be comfortable for you to do a thing every day. And start with it. </p>
            <br>
            <p> 3. Never skip a day. Have a contingency plan. </p>
            <br>
            <p> Suppose you want to do yoga every morning.  And you've already started with this habit. You have your streak of N days. And at some point, you get the flu. You have the fever and it is impossible for you to do your morning yoga thing. </p>
            <br>
            <p> So lets come up with a contingency plan for this.  It can be an action that is even smaller and easier than your MVA. Since when this happens your MVA could already be pretty advanced. </p>
            <br>
            <p> You can take out the yoga mat (if it is what you usually do) place it in its spot and just sit on it for a couple of minutes. Or just stand on it for a bit. If you are too sick even for that - just sit in the bed under the blanket and imagine doing the yoga. Imagine every detail, think about every move and the transitions between them. It should take you approximately the same amount of time that it usually takes you to do the whole workout. The point is that even if your body can not do something at this moment you can still reinforce the habit in your brain. </p>
            <br>
            <p> Or you overslept and you are very late so you don't have the time. Stuff happens. Come up with the MVA for such situations. Set a timer for one minute and stop to do the workout for that minute. Take out the yoga mat, put it on the floor and right away put it back. Pick an action that you can do even if you don't have time. </p>
            <br>
            <p> The contingency plan exists not to further your skill (playing guitar, doing yoga, etc). Its sole purpose is to keep your streak alive and not just freeze it but actually to increase the counter to N+1. You do this because it helps you to keep going to come back to your habit tomorrow. </p>
            <br>
            <p> So there we have it. Three hopefully helpful tips to get you on the path of creating habits: </p>
            <br>
            <ol>
                <li> Come up with a minimum viable action; </li> <br>
                <li> Choose the time you are going to associate with this action; </li> <br>
                <li> have a contingency plan in case something prevents you from doing the habit today. </li> <br>
            </ol>
