        <h1> How to deal with insufferable questions from ignorant people </h1>

        <br>

        <p>Let me describe a situation for you. You're having a lovely day. Things are going your way. Maybe you just got a raise or landed a contract you wanted. </p>
        <br>
        <p>And you unexpectedly run into an old acquaintance, let's call them P for person. You are happy to see P, it's been a long time, and you want to catch up. P also is pleased to see you and is eager to chat. What could possibly go wrong? </p>
        <br>
        <p>The conversation starts something like this:</p>
        <p>You: Hey! Lovely to bump into you. How are you?</p>
        <p>P: Hi! Great to see you. I'm good, just did A and B. How are you?</p>
        <p>You: Wow, congrats on A and B. I'm going for C now and I'm very happy to have finished the D project.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Forgive my poor dialogue writing skills. But you get the point. It's a lovely exchange. And then this happens:</p>
        <br>
        <p>P: So when are you planning to have kids? / get married / why did you dye your hair green / or something else equally out of nowhere and inappropriate </p>
        <br>
        <p>Your heart sinks. There are no words to say. Well, there are a few words, like: Whaaaat? And some rude ones, I'm sure you know them.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In these situations, my head starts spinning a little bit. Why would they ask this? How is this related to what I said before?  </p>
        <br>
        <p>These questions always have the assumption that whatever you are doing with your life is meaningless and not worth doing. </p>
        <br>
        <p>So what do you do if you don't want to be rude and do not want to participate in that sort of interrogation? </p>
        <br>
        <p>The answer is so simple it's ridiculous. Just ask P a question:</p>
        <p>You: Why are you asking me this?</p>
        <br>
        <p>Do this with as much compassion in your voice as you can gather. That's it. Simple and yet so powerful.</p>
        <br>
        <p>With this one simple question, you turn attention away from yourself and onto P. Without being rude, mean, or angry. That clearly shows P that their question was inappropriate. There even might be something wrong with them because they asked.</p>
        <br>
        <p>But honestly, none of that even matters. What matters is that you don't have to explain or defend your life choices. The conversation is no longer about you. P can now try and figure out their way out. Whatever P does next, you can always ask more questions: </p>
        <br>
        <p>What do you want to talk about this? Is everything okay with you?</p>
        <br>
        <p>You can watch little clips with interviews on YouTube where actors shut down inappropriate questions in a graceful way. Notice that the recipe is always the same. They ask the interviewer: "Why are you asking me this?". That destroys the accusational-interrogational rhythm. And sounds very impressive. </p>
        <br>
        <p>Keep it friendly. A sarcastic tone might dampen your higher ground a little. Be kind and considerate, and also consider never talking to this person again.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I hope this helped. Thank you for your time!</p>
